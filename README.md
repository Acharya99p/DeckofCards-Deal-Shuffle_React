How to use?

Once the app gets initialized, add a new deck using the plus icon on the bottom-right corner of the screen.

Once a deck gets added, all you need to do is click the deck in the list of decks.

On the cards page, you can shuffle the cards or draw a card.
   Drawing will remove the first card from the deck.
   Shuffle is a random shuffle
